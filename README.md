App name: Job center.

App purpose:  user will be able to trackjob application progress.

the user will be able create, edit, delete and view all job applications.

App using redux toolkit.

i created three slices and communicated between them.

i created a communication between the server and the frontend application.

i set up authorized requests since all the dashboard routes are protected.

the landing page where the user is going to navigate if he or she has not logged in!

 if the user hasn't logged in or registered, then. They will navigate back to the landing page.


 the app have a register page and in the case of error and success will also display some nice alerts.

 in the dashboard, there's going to be a stats page, Where we display nice cards, How many applications are currently pending?, How many jobs have been declined?, And below i have a chart where i display monthly applications.

 if I search for the jobs where I have only the interview and of course I will only see these values and each job is going to be represented with this nice card.

 I can also clear the filters and there's also going to be a pagination, which by the way, is going to work as i am filtering.
